# phase-3-blog-project

Welcome to my phase-3 project. In this project I used React to development my frontend and Sinatra for the backend. I've decided to create a working blog for this project where users can post daily blogs, edit existing blogs, or delete a post entirely. 

## Getting Started

To get started, cd into blog-client to get your frontend working. Then run,

npm install

npm start

On a new terminal, cd into blog-server and run,

bundle exec install

bundle exec rake db:migrate db:seed

bundle exec rake server
